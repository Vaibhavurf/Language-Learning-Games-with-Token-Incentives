## Project Title
Language-Learning Games with Token Incentives

## Project Description
This project integrates language learning with blockchain technology to create an engaging and rewarding experience. Users can participate in language-learning games, earn tokens based on their performance, and redeem those tokens for rewards. The platform incentivizes learning by gamifying the process and ensuring transparency through smart contract implementation.
